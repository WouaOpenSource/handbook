# The First 90 Days

We are small, and very selective about who we bring in. Most organisations hire people based on their previous role and compensation, but not us. Our salaries are fair and equitable, which means everyone delivering the same value gets paid the same. To fairly identify what value a new hire might bring to the table, we take them through a 3 month bootcamp program where we immerse them in our ways of working. This helps us as well as the new hire, understand their value in our org, based on which we offer them a position. Not only does this process ensure that we don’t hire someone who looks good on paper but can’t deliver high quality work, it also helps fairly compensate people who do not have the negotiation skills to demand a salary they truly deserve.
