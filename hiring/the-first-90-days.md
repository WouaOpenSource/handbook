# The First 90 Days

## The What

Irrespective of experience and seniority, every new hire at Obvious goes through a three month fellowship program. The fellowship is a mutual fit assessment opportunity for the candidate, as well as for Obvious. Our goal is to fairly identify the value the new hire brings to the table by deeply immersing them in our ways of working, and then evaluating them on each axis of our 12 axes growth rubric. This evaluation helps us and the candidate understand their value in the org, based on which they are offered a position.

## The Why

We are small, and very selective about who we bring in. Most organisations hire people based on their previous role and compensation, but not us. Our salaries are fair and equitable, which means everyone delivering the same value gets paid the same. The fellowship not only ensures that we don’t hire someone who looks good on paper but can’t deliver high quality work, it also helps fairly compensate people who do not have the negotiation skills to demand a salary they truly deserve.
