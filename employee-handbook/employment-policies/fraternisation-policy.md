# Fraternisation Policy

## Fraternisation among colleagues

We don’t want to place undue restrictions on employees dating colleagues, as we acknowledge that freedom of choosing one’s partner is an individual’s right. But, without some norms, romantic or sexual relationships between colleagues may lead to an unsafe workplace. Any instance of unprofessional or disrespectful behaviour among colleagues will invite strict disciplinary action against staff members.

## Fraternisation with Interns

Interns are professionals occupying the workplace for a brief period, who do not enjoy the full benefits and protections available to other members. Therefore, Obvious places a positive duty of care on all staff members to treat interns with utmost respect and professional support.

Staff members, including permanent/temporary staff, consultants, individuals sharing our workplace, and any other person in a potential supervisory role should be scrupulously professional and respectful in their interactions with interns, both at the workplace and outside it.

Any instance of unprofessional or disrespectful behaviour with interns will invite strict disciplinary action against staff members. Any romantic or intimate relationships that may develop between a staff member and an intern should be immediately disclosed by the staff member to the Directors, with a request to be relieved from any direct or indirect supervisory role.

Failure to disclose a personal relationship with an intern will be treated as a serious violation of professional standards and will invite disciplinary action.
