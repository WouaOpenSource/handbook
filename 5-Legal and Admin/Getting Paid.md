## **Invoicing Basics and Legal Compliance.** 

**Your invoice should have the following details on it:**

- Your full name (as it appears on your PAN card or any government issued ID)
- Your address, which matches your PAN card or any government issued ID
- Uncommon’s registered company name: **Unicus Web Designing Private Limited**
- Our registered business address: **38-126/C, Bhaskara Nilayam, Ambedkar Nagar, Sainikpuri, Hyderabad - 500094, Telangana, India**
- If you are registered to pay GST, include your GSTIN (15-digits). Also include your SAC code—you can find [an exhaustive list of SAC codes here](https://cleartax.in/s/sac-codes-gst-rates-for-services), but for the most of you, SAC code 998314 should suffice. Please double-check with your CA for the SAC code that you need to put on your invoice.
- If you are registered to pay GST, you usually would add 18% GST to your invoice amount. 
  - If you are registered in the state of Telangana, you will add GST as a combination of CGST and SGST — 9% CGST and 9% SGST.
  - If you are registered in any state apart from the state of Telangana, you would need to pay InterState GST; please mention 18% IGST on your invoices.
- Unicus Web Designing’s GSTIN: **36AABCU7589A1Z6**
- Your Signature
- All your invoices should have a unique alphanumeric invoice number for every financial year.
- Print your bank details on every invoice, including the following: 
  - Bank Name
  - Branch
  - Branch Address
  - Branch IFSC Code
  - Bank Account Number
- On your invoice, mention the exact number of **working days** that you have worked, broken up per client.
- Send your invoice on the last day of the month for the preceding month; i.e, send an invoice for the days that you have worked in August on the 31st of August to [finance@obvious.in](mailto:finance@obvious.in)
- Your invoices will be cleared within 15 days of being approved, so if approved by the 1st of September, you should see a payment in your bank account before 15th September.

## **Reimbursements**

- If you have had to spend money on work-related expenses, Obvious will reimburse you for this. Please note, that any reimbursement will have to be **pre-approved**. Examples of reimbursements can include travel (flights etc), food, software, hardware etc.
- Create **separate invoices** for reimbursements - do not club your professional fees with them. Different tax rules and compliances apply to both.
- It’s easier to not have to do reimbursements, so check first whether Rahul/Dhruv/Pratul can purchase whatever you need.
