# Coaching

Coaching is the preferred option to deal with underperformance and is the first step in addressing performance issues.

Managers are expected to address performance concerns \(poor results and/or behavior issues\) in a timely manner. Managers should address concerns verbally during one-on-one meetings or in impromptu private coaching sessions with their team member. These conversations should be documented by the manager and shared with the team member so that everyone has a record of the discussion and is in alignment on where improvements needs to be made and by when. Documentation should be brief \(a few key bullet points or a paragraph\), and should be shared with the team member within 24 hours of the verbal discussion.

Helping Obvious team-members understand clearly how their performance is below the standard expected quickly is very important to foster immediate improvement and continued success. It is also important to clarify when feedback given can provide helpful coaching vs. when to address a serious performance issue. It is not always clear how serious the feedback being provided is and setting the context can be critical. If there are extenuating circumstances, some leeway may be granted depending on the situation. This is an area where someone in the People Ops/Exec team can provide a sounding board or voice of reason.

When underperformance is detected, managers should compensate by checking their report's work more frequently.
