# Letting Someone Go

This should be discussed with both the Exec team and with People Ops before any action is taken in order to ensure it is done in compliance with local laws and regulation. As soon as you know you'll have to let someone go, do it immediately. The team member is entitled to know where they stand. Delaying it for days or weeks causes problems with confidentiality \(finding out that they will be let go\), causation \(attributing it to another reason\), and escalation \(the working relationship is probably going downhill\).
