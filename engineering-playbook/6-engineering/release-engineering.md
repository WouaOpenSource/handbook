# Release Engineering

Whenever a team is trying to ship a product, there are 3 major worries…

* Features
* Quality
* Schedule

Given any sort of constraint, the first thing that is kicked off the list are Features! Teams are always aiming for top notch quality, because high quality brings with it many advantages:

* High quality means less maintenance in the future 
* … means less stress for the team
* … means longevity of the system in production

Organisations want a Trusted Schedule that they can believe in. It helps align the organisation and work like an efficient machine.

* New products can be planned accordingly, because results for the current one will arrive in a predictable fashion
* Other engineering teams \(API, infrastructure, IT\) know when to expect something new and be prepared
* Even Marketing and PR teams are happy!
