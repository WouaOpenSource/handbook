# Compensation

The following policy applies to India employees and all full-time contractors.

## Salary

Fair compensation is critical to making Obvious a desirable place to work and helping our employees lead happy, healthy lives inside and outside of the office. When used as a motivational tool, though, it can incentivize the wrong kind of optimizations. Our goal with salary is that it checks the box of "enough" for folks who are excited about working at Obvious \(because of our mission, people and work\) and then fades into the background.

Obvious evaluates compensation annually. Our ability to offer raises is dependent on our current financial situation.

## Bonuses

Obvious does not currently give bonuses for any reason.
