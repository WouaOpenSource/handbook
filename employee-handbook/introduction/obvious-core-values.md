# Our Core Values

Obvious was formed with certain core values which we have held, evolved and iterated over time. These are some of the values which have endured - and some derivatives of those values as well.

## We build with care.

We care deeply about **our craft** \(whether design or engineering\), and aim to practice it at its highest level. We care equally about the **contexts** in which our work exists, and will strive to understand it and respond to them with sophistication and compassion.

## We are generous.

As a company, we recognise that we have benefited hugely from the generosity of others. We will strive to be equally generous, and paying it forward. That generosity can manifest as extra attention to detail in places that others may not notice. It could manifest as helping out our coworkers, clients or the broader community.

## We embrace weakness as strength.

As a small, self-funded business, we have to operate within certain constraints. Those constraints have to be seen not as shackles, but as means to encourage efficiency, and to continuously adjust our efforts appropriately.

## We operate with openness and transparency.

As a company, we will operate openly and transparently. Many of the systemic problems that exist in our industry and allied ones are because of huge information asymmetries. We will have most of our work, philosophies and process be public by default.

## We don't have all of the answers.

As a company, we realize that we won't have all of the answers. That means that it's important for us to listen to our users, and iterate often based on their feedback.

It means that as employees, we embrace others' feedback. We admit our mistakes, are vocally self-critical, and help each other find ways to continue growing and improving over time. We put systems in place to help us improve our processes continuously.

Trust is the currency that powers every interaction on teams. Only when we trust each other can we share the candid feedback and opinions that let us be creative and successful. We give our coworkers deep visibility into how our decisions are made and easy outlets to help them give input and guide our course. When we build trust through good communication, we create an environment for better communication in the future.

## We fight the default of exclusion.

Inequality and exclusion are the defaults of our industry \(design, technology and consulting\). Without intentional effort, we will inherit those failings and worsen the problem. Building a diverse team is a moral imperative and we build a better business and product by bringing different perspectives to the table. We look for voices unlike our own because they are the only ones that help us grow.
