# Drug and Alcohol Policy

Our priority at Obvious is to create a safe, comfortable, and productive environment for everyone we work with. We realize that drugs and alcohol can contribute to a culture of harassment or one that feels unsafe for some employees, even as it can foster camaraderie and friendship among others. Above all other considerations, our drug and alcohol policy is intended to preempt and avoid harassment and make working at Obvious feel safe.

Alcohol may be served at Obvious events, such as at team dinners or at Obvious team off-sites. **It is the responsibility of every employee to ensure that their individual consumption is not making anyone else feel uncomfortable or unsafe.** Employees who violate this policy may face disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

Illegal drugs should not be used, bought, sold, or distributed while working either in the office or remotely while representing Obvious. For the purposes of this handbook, "illegal" shall mean as defined by the local laws where you are working or representing Obvious \(e.g., the laws of the State of Karnataka, if you are working in Bengaluru\).
