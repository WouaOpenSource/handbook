# Underperformance

## Introduction

We want people to be successful and should give every opportunity for individuals to work effectively. Important deliverables or being understaffed is not a good reason to keep a team member who is underperforming. We owe it to all of those on the team to maintain a high standard of performance among all teammates. In addition, we also want our teammates to be successful, and recognize that they may be more successful at another company.

In all cases, we want a manager who asks themselves the question "Is this the best person I could hire today?" to respond with a "**Yes!**".

## Discuss circumstance immediately with your manager

If there are circumstances in your life that cause you to be less effective immediately tell your manager. It isn't required to give details if you prefer not to. Tell your manager when it started, to what extend it hinders your work, and what your forecast is for it to get better. When you delay this conversation until your manager identifies underperformance you've lost trust that would be helpful to get through this period.

## Identify and take action as early as possible

Taking action sooner allows the action to be less severe and allows more time for coaching to have an effect. The important thing to remember is to always address any early signs of underperformance immediately.

## Discuss immediately with the manager's manager

Underperformance is between a team member, the manager, and their manager. That is because the manager of the manager needs to see that underperformance is identified early and can help advising proportional actions to address it. Taking early action on underperformance is one of the most important ways to get results and an essential manager skill. In order to take the best action and show you are handling it please inform your manager immediately when you've identified possible underperformance. If your manager warns you about possible underperformance before you tell them you've not practiced always tell us the bad news promptly, this diminishes the trust that is needed to resolve the situation. Since possible underperformance is an important topic to talk about as soon as possible it is the first item of the [1-1 agenda](../../employee-handbook/conversations/one-on-ones.md). Managing underperformance is very important because it sets the standard for the performance we accept. It is hard because frequently the underperformance is due to a mistake we made in hiring, on boarding and/or coaching. It is also hard because it is a hard message to give and receive that someone's performance is not adequate.
