# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct applies to all community members \(e.g., open source contributors and other volunteers\) and Obvious team members in all Obvious communities online \(including but not limited to Obvious's internal and external Slack groups, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram\), while working in the Obvious office or remotely, at all events hosted by Obvious, at industry events attended by a Obvious employee, whether or not directly representing Obvious.

Obvious is dedicated to creating an inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, color, sex \(with or without sexual conduct and including pregnancy and sexual orientation involving transgender status/gender identity, and sex-stereotyping\), national origin, age, disability \(physical or mental\), genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, marital status, and political affiliation as well as gender expression, medical condition, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro\(a\)typicality, physical appearance, body size, computing experience, or clothing.

We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to the protected classes above, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Harassment does not need to be recognized as unwanted or unwelcome by anyone other than the person being harassed.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Offensive jokes are not appropriate and will not be tolerated under any circumstance. Consider that calling attention to differences can feel alienating.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Community members violating these rules may be sanctioned or removed from community spaces. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one of the founders, a member of the [Prevention of Sexual Harassment Committee](prevention-of-sexual-harassment.md) or a member of the Board of Directors immediately.

## Complaint Policy

Obvious has a virtual open-door policy, so employees are encouraged to report work-related concerns. If something about your job is bothering you, or if you have a question, concern, idea, or problem related to your work, please discuss it with Rahul as soon as possible. If for any reason you don’t feel comfortable discussing it with Rahul, feel free to raise the issue with any of the other founders or anyone on the Board of Directors. We encourage employees to come forward with any workplace complaint, even if it’s not about something that’s explicitly covered in our written policies.
