# Obvious's Core Values

## We operate with openness and transparency.

As a company, we will operate openly and transparently. We will not keep secrets or hide information unless there is a good reason to do so, such as to maintain our users' privacy.

## Start small and iterate quickly.

We believe that the best path to safety, efficacy, usability and functionality that matters is to start small and then iterate. For example, we may deliver a Minimum Viable Product \(MVP\), and then iterate based on feedback from our users in the real world.

## We don't have all of the answers.

As a company, we realize that we won't have all of the answers. That means that it's important for us to listen to our users, and iterate often based on their feedback. \(See "Start small and iterate quickly" above.\)

It means that as employees, we embrace others' feedback. We admit our mistakes, are vocally self-critical, and help each other find ways to continue growing and improving over time. We put systems in place to help us improve our processes continuously.

Trust is the currency that powers every interaction on teams. Only when we trust each other can we share the candid feedback and opinions that let us be creative and successful. We give our coworkers deep visibility into how our decisions are made and easy outlets to help them give input and guide our course. When we build trust through good communication, we create an environment for better communication in the future.

## Fight the default of exclusion.

Inequality and exclusion are the defaults of our industry \(software development\). Without intentional effort, we will inherit those failings and worsen the problem. Building a diverse team is a moral imperative and we build a better business and product by bringing different perspectives to the table. We look for voices unlike our own because they are the only ones that help us grow.
