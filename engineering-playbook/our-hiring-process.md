# Our hiring process

Thank you for considering Obvious as a potential workplace -- [we're](https://obvious.in/team/) stoked! Hiring procedures make everyone anxious and nervous -- including us -- and we want to make your experience with us as smooth as possible. 

This process is not something that is set in stone. We keep iterating, and the steps tend to be slightly different for everyone -- just like everyone who goes through them!

So, here are the 5 stages you can expect when you interview with us.

## 0. Check our open positions

We publish our open positions [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/obvious-hq), while also announcing them on [our Twitter](https://twitter.com/obvious_in/) account. 

{% hint style="success" %}
Our compensation is the same for everyone on the same level. Our salaries are public internally. We don't ask for your payslips to decide how much we will pay you, and we don't engage in salary negotations.
{% endhint %}

## 1. Send us your CV

Most CVs contain information that is prone to bias. For e.g.: photo, demographic information, education history. So when you send us your CV, we want you to send a fairly abbreviated document containing the following... 

{% hint style="warning" %}
We will reject your CV if you don't send it in this specific format.
{% endhint %}

* Your work experience in full detail:
  * What are the places you have worked at, when, and for how long?
  * What positions did you hold? 
  * Describe some projects you worked on. Talk about your specific responsibility and contribution. 
  * Who else was part of those projects? What were their contributions?
  * Tell us about some misses you've had, and what you learned from them.
* Side projects you might have, related to the position:
  * These could be hobby projects, open source contributions, or anything else you think is interesting that you'd like to share with us.

_We'll get back to you in 4-5 days._

## 2. Answer the "Opinion Questions"

As a team, we're quite an opinionated one! It helps us to listen to everyone -- we end up learning from each other's point of view. To know you better, we ask you to write down answers to these 4 questions:

**Q1.** What advice would you give to your younger self \(back when you started programming\)?   
**Q2.** What is your favourite programming language, or framework? Why? What do you not like about it?   
**Q3.** What are some of your favourite technical essays, books, or videos? What do you like about them?   
**Q4.** Why do you want to be at Obvious? 

We're not judging your English skills here. Instead, we're looking for clarity of thought and explanation. There are no right or wrong answers to these questions. All of us have very different thoughts on them, shaped by our experiences, and we hope your answers will make for a riveting discussion. 

_We'll get back to you in 2-3 days._

## 3. In-person Conversation

We invite you to our office for an hour-long friendly conversation with our engineering lead to understand your journey so far, what you're looking for in the future, and any questions you might have about Obvious. You should go through our Playbook beforehand -- it answers many frequently asked questions!

_We'll get back to you in 2-3 days._

## 4. Homework Exercise

Aha, finally some code! We're not fond of asking questions around algorithms or data structures or even on-site whiteboarding exercises. Instead, we will ask you to build a small app using publicly available resources. 

* You do this exercise at your own pace, on your own computer, and in an environment that is comfortable for you. 
* We expect you to use git, commit code as you go along, and build the app iteratively -- just as you would during a normal workday. 
* When you're done, you give us access privately to your git repository, or simply email us the entire thing. We'll go through what you've built and get back to you in a few days.

_We'll get back to you in 4-5 days._

## 5. Obvious Day

This is the last step in our process, congratulations! You will be spending a day at our office, meeting our team, seeing how we work, and writing some code. You'll eat lunch with the team, and if we can convince you, go out for some tea and snacks in the evening. 

### Technical interview: 1 hour

You talk to one or two engineers from our team about your technical journey. Expect the questions to be practical, platform specific, and related to the kind of work you've done. We might end up discussing your answers to the Opinion Questions, and talking about the choices you've made in the Homework Exercise. 

### Pairing exercise: 2 hours

You pair with an engineer on the Homework Exercise code you wrote. This might involve refactoring or adding some features. To make you comfortable, we will do this on your computer, or give you time to setup one of our computers to fit your usage. 

### Mentor a Junior Developer: 1 hour

If you're interviewing for an experienced position, we ask you to explain a concept/pattern to a junior developer. You may use a computer or whiteboard or anything else you feel comfortable with. One of our engineers will silently shadow this discussion.

_We'll get back to you in 2-3 days._

## Done!

That's all! We aim to close all conversations within 7 days of you finishing the process.
