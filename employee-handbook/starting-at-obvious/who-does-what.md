# Who Does What

Figuring out who to bring a particular issue or question to shouldnâ€™t be a guessing game. Most concerns fall pretty clearly within the responsibility of a specific team at Obvious, and the head of that team should be the first point of contact. At the same time, every single person who works at Obvious is approachable and friendly, more than willing to point you in the right direction. If you have a question, you're probably not the first, so speak up!
