# Employee Privacy

### Email Privacy

Obvious email is not being actively monitored by anyone, but because it is a company resource that is managed according to company policy, you should not expect privacy. The company has both the ability and the right to look at employee usage to protect both employee safety and well being, as well as company property and interests.

Email messages, including attachments, sent and received from a Obvious email address are the property of Obvious. We reserve the right to access, monitor, read, and/or copy email messages at any time, for any reason. You should not expect privacy for any email you send using your Obvious email, including messages that you consider to be personal or label with a designation such as “Personal” or “Private.”

### Use of the Email System for Personal Email

The email system is intended for official Company business. If you send personal messages through the Company’s email system, you must exercise discretion as to the number and type of messages you send. You must also ensure that your personal use of the email system does not interfere in any way with your job duties or performance.

### All Conduct Rules Apply to Email

All of our policies and rules of conduct apply to employee use of the email system. This means, for example, that you may not use the email system to send harassing or discriminatory messages, including messages with explicit sexual content or pornographic images; to send threatening messages; or to reveal company confidential information.

### Professional Tone and Content

We expect you to exercise discretion in your electronic communications. When you send email using a Obvious email address or Obvious social account, you are representing Obvious. Make sure that your messages are professional and appropriate, in tone and content. Remember, although email or social media may seem like a private conversation, they can be printed, saved, and forwarded to unintended recipients. You should not send any email/message/update/etc. that you wouldn’t want our team, your family, or our competitors to read.

### Email Security

To avoid email viruses, phishing for account information, and other threats, employees should not open email attachments from people and businesses they don’t recognize, particularly if the email appears to have been forwarded multiple times or has a nonexistent or peculiar subject heading. Even if you know the sender, do not open an email attachment that has a strange name or is not referenced in the body of the email; it may have been transmitted automatically, without the sender’s knowledge.

If you believe your computer has been infected by a virus, worm, or other security threat to Obvious’s system, you must inform the Chief Security Office \(currently Rahul\) immediately.

Employees may not share their email passwords with anyone, including coworkers or family members. Revealing passwords to the Company’s email system could allow an outsider to attack the Obvious network.

### Privacy when using Obvious's Communication Tools

Some Obvious employees have administrative access to some or all of Obvious's communication and collaboration tools, including Obvious-managed Google apps and accounts, Slack, Trello, and Pivotal Tracker. We reserve the right to monitor employee use of the Obvious's communication tools at any time. You should not expect that your use of these communication tools, including but not limited to the sites you visit and the communications you have, will be private.
