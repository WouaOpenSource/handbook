# Performance Improvement Plan \(PIP\)

### Not a first step to letting someone go

Many companies use a PIP for most involuntary terminations, as documented support for releasing a team member. At Obvious we think that giving someone a plan while you intend to let them go is a bad experience for the team member, their manager, and the rest of the team. A PIP at Obvious is not used to "check the box" a PIP is a genuine last chance to resolve underperformance. You should only offer a PIP if you are confident that the team member can successfully complete it. The team member should also be committed to successfully completing the PIP and maintaining the level of performance arrived at through the PIP. A PIP will not be successful unless the team member and the manager believes they can succeed.

#### SMART Goals

As part of the PIP the manager will work with the team member to define SMART goals. SMART goals, allow both the manager and team member to define requirements, track progress, and improve communication of expectations for success during the PIP period.

**SMART** is an acronym that can be used in creating the PIP requirements. To make sure goals, are clear and reachable, each one should be:

* **Specific:** Specifically define what you expect the employee to do/deliver. Avoid generalities and use action verbs as much as possible.
* **Measurable:** You should be able to measure whether the employee is meeting the goals, or not. Identify how you will measure success - usually stated in terms of quantity, quality, timeliness or cost \(e.g. increase by 25%\).
* **Achievable:** Make sure that accomplishing the goal is within the employee's realm of authority and capabilities. While considering whether a goal is actionable/achievable, you also need to consider the employee's total set of goals. While each individual goal may be achievable, overall, you may be assigning the employee more goals, than they can reasonably be expected to successfully complete.
* **Realistic:** Can the employee realistically achieve the objectives with the resources available? Ensure the goal is practical, results-oriented and within the employees realm of authority and capabilities. Also, Relevant: Where appropriate, link the goal to a higher-level departmental or organizational goal, and ensure that the employee understands how their goal and actions contributes to the attainment of the higher level goal. This give the employee a context for their work.
* **Time-bound:** When does the objective need to be completed? Specify when the goal needs to be completed \(e.g. by the end of the quarter, or every month\).

#### **Sample SMART Goals:**

Bad SMART Goal: "Improve overall qualified sales lead".

Good SMART Goal: "In May, June and July, Kaveri must have an increase of 20% in overall qualified sales leads entered into Pipedrive"

Bad SMART Goal: "Increase Fix defects"

Good SMART Goal: "Fix at least 8 defects. Must be fixed with code changes, not closing as "Won't Fix, "Not Reproducible". All defects must be dev completed/merged by end of business Monday, June 1st, 2020".

### How to deliver a PIP

* Once [the PIP is documented](sample-pip-letter.md) schedule a meeting with the team member outside of the regular 1-1
* Present the PIP to them and go through it with them. Read it verbatim and don't deviate from it or think of other things to add during the meeting
* Re-iterate that you want them to improve and you're there to support them. You will be checking their progress each week \(or day if really necessary\)
* Ask them if they have any questions
* Inform People Ops that the PIP conversation has taken place and the document have been sent to the team member.

### Confidential

The PIP process is between a manager and their direct report. Information shared in a PIP should be kept confidential by both participants. If underperformance becomes a reason for termination, the individual should not be taken by surprise but the rest of the company should be.
